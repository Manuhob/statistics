# Statistics

This repository contains some notes that I've been taking in my very personal journey on learning some topics in Statistics. 

My learning technique reflecting my personality. I follow a learning system based on the following steps:

1. **Understanding the example.** This is the hardest part as it is one of the most difficult parts when learning a topic to find an example that is at the same time *non-trivial* (so that it captures all the sublteties of your result) and *easy enough* so that it can be understood without further theory. This is approach is of course inspired by the excelent advice from Atiyah ["The most useful piece of advice I would give to a mathematics student is always to suspect an impressive sounding Theorem if it does not have a special case which is both simple and non-trivial."](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Atiyah/quotations/)

2. **Writing the Theorems.** Without much generality, so that it can be seen right away the formalization of the previous example.

3. **Further the topic.** Basically it is a deepening on the topic by succesive iteration of the previous two points.
